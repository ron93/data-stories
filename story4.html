    <h1>THE HARE AND THE HYENA</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Once upon a time there lived two animals named Hare and Hyena. They were very big friends and they lived together. Everything they had they shared together.
One day the drought came all around so they decided to look for food but they did not get any more. They thought and thought what to do. There lived a farmer who had a big shamba, so the animals went and asked him to give them work to do so that he would give them some food. The farmer gave them a place to work and gave them beans and maize so when they were working the food was being prepared. They worked and worked and when they were about to finish, Hyena went to a river to wash himself. He came back making a lot of noise saying "Oh! Oh! Oh! What is this! Jini! Jini! Jini!"<br>
            So Hare ran away and so did Hyena. The Hyena came back and ate all the food. Hare came back and Hyena pretended that someone else had stolen their food and eaten it. Hare saw beans on Hyena's teeth and thought something was strange..</p>
	<p>	The next day Hyena did the same thing again, but on the third day Hare thought what he would do. Hare took a very big sack that the farmer used and hid behind a bog stone. When Hyena came shouting the way he did Hare jumped out and put Hyena in the sack, took a very big stick and beat Hyena until he started to cry.<br>
Hyena shouted "Who is that beating me?"
Hare said " I am your friend that you always trick."
So Hyena came out of the sack crying and went away. The Hare ate the meal they had prepared and Hyena felt hungry.
        From that day they did not like each other - they have never been friends since.</p></article>
